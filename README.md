• Homework 1 (To be completed within 06/10) ✅

  ‣ Application: Create a simple application in C# and VB.net to play with handlers and to understand sintax differences between them two
 
   The application I chose to develop is a simple Windows Form with a button and 4 RichTextBoxes that simulates the behaviour of a stoplight, by hoovering over the          button the stoplight becomes yellow whereas when clicking the button it switches between red and green and a message saying which light is currently lit pops up in      the bottom box, finally by leaving the area of the button all the boxes reset themselves.
